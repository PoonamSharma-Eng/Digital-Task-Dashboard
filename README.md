**Digital Task Dashboard**

I created this project to demonstrate my frontend development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a functional task manager that allows users to add and delete tasks in real-time.

**Key Features:**

**Dynamic UI:** Tasks are added instantly without refreshing the page.

**Clean Design:** Styled with CSS for a professional, modern look.

**JavaScript Logic:** Uses DOM manipulation to handle task entries.

**How to use it:**

Clone this repository or download the index.html file.

Open index.html in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, or Edge).

Start managing your tasks!
